        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Initializing all weights to the same value using He initialization is not recommended. He initialization, which scales the weights based on the number of inputs to a neuron, is designed to prevent the vanishing or exploding gradient problem during training. However, setting all weights to the same value would negate the purpose of He initialization because it would eliminate any diversity in the initial weights.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Initializing bias terms to 0 is a common practice in many neural network architectures and is generally considered acceptable. This is because the role of the bias term is to provide the model with the ability to shift the activation function by adding a constant value. Initializing bias terms to 0 at the beginning allows the network to start with a neutral bias and then adjust it during the training process according to the data.\n",

        "Moreover, initializing bias terms to 0 simplifies the initialization process and avoids introducing additional randomness into the model, which can sometimes be beneficial for reproducibility.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation function offers several advantages over the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Self-normalization:** SELU activation promotes self-normalization in deep neural networks. This means that, under certain conditions (e.g., the weights are initialized according to specific criteria), the activations of each layer tend to converge towards zero mean and unit variance during training. This can mitigate the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, leading to more stable training dynamics and potentially faster convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. No need for batch normalization:** SELU activation eliminates the need for additional normalization techniques like batch normalization in many cases. This simplifies the network architecture, reduces computational overhead, and makes the model more straightforward to train and deploy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Smoothness and continuity:** SELU is a smooth and continuous function, unlike ReLU, which has a non-differentiable point at zero. This smoothness can be advantageous during optimization, as it allows gradient-based optimization algorithms to navigate the parameter space more effectively, potentially leading to better convergence and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, these advantages make SELU a compelling choice, especially for deep neural networks, where stability during training and efficient optimization are critical concerns. However, it's worth noting that SELU may not always outperform ReLU in every scenario, and the choice of activation function should depend on factors such as network architecture, data characteristics, and computational constraints.\n",

        "**Ans:**\n",
        "Setting the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1, such as 0.99999, when using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer can lead to several potential issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Overshooting and Oscillations:** With very high momentum values, the optimizer tends to rely heavily on past gradients, which can cause it to overshoot the minimum point of the loss function. This overshooting behavior can lead to oscillations around the minimum, making it difficult for the optimizer to converge to a stable solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Slow Convergence:** While momentum helps in accelerating convergence by allowing the optimizer to persist in the direction of past gradients, setting it too close to 1 can result in slow convergence. This is because the optimizer may become overly conservative in updating the weights, especially when encountering steep gradients, which slows down the learning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Difficulty in Escaping Local Minima:** High momentum values can make it challenging for the optimizer to escape local minima or saddle points in the loss landscape. Instead, the optimizer may get trapped in these suboptimal points due to its strong reliance on past gradients, hindering the exploration of the parameter space.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Sensitivity to Noise:** Extremely high momentum values can make the optimizer more sensitive to noise in the gradients, leading to erratic behavior during training. Small fluctuations in the gradients can have a significant impact on the weight updates, causing instability in the optimization process.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping (setting to zero) a proportion of neurons' outputs in a layer. Here's how dropout affects training and inference, and the differences with MC Dropout:\n",
        "\n",
        "Training Speed:\n",
        "Dropout can slow down training to some extent because it introduces additional computation. During each training iteration, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neuron activations to zero, effectively reducing the information flow through the network. As a result, the network needs more iterations to converge compared to training without dropout. However, the slowdown is usually manageable and outweighed by the regularization benefits it provides.\n",
        "Inference Speed:\n",
        "Dropout does not affect inference speed since it is only applied during training. During inference (i.e., making predictions on new instances), the entire network is used without dropout. Therefore, inference speed remains unaffected, and dropout does not introduce any computational overhead during prediction time.\n",
        "MC Dropout:\n",
        "MC Dropout (Monte Carlo Dropout) is an extension of dropout that can be used during both training and inference. During inference, MC Dropout involves performing multiple forward passes through the network with dropout enabled and averaging the predictions. This process captures the uncertainty in the model's predictions, providing more reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. While MC Dropout does introduce additional computation during inference, it can improve the robustness and reliability of the model's predictions, especially in tasks where uncertainty estimation is important, such as in Bayesian neural networks.\n",
        "In summary, dropout can slightly slow down training due to the additional computation involved, but it does not affect inference speed. MC Dropout introduces additional computation during inference but can improve the reliability of predictions by capturing predictive uncertainty. Therefore, the choice of whether to use dropout or MC Dropout depends on the specific requirements of the task, including the need for regularization and uncertainty estimation.\n",
